Field	Description	Source
APPLICATION_ID	The application number identifies: type of application (1), activity code (R01), organization to which it is assigned (AI), serial number assigned by the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) (183723), suffix showing the support year for the grant (-01), other information identifying a supplement (S1), resubmission (A1), or a fellowship's institutional allowance.

ACTIVITY	A 3-character code used to identify a specific category of extramural research activity, applied to various funding mechanisms. NIH uses three funding mechanisms for extramural research awards: grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. Within each funding mechanism, NIH uses 3-character activity codes (e.g., F32, K08, P01, R01, T32, etc.) to differentiate the wide variety of research-related programs NIH supports. A comprehensive list of activity codes may be found on the Types of Grant Programs Web page.	Glossary (http://report.nih.gov/glossary.aspx)

An I/C may request to change this assignment if the application is more suited to another I/C. Also referred to as primary assignment.	Glossary (http://report.nih.gov/glossary.aspx)

PI_IDS	The individual(s) designated by the applicant organization to have the appropriate level of authority and responsibility to direct the project or program to be supported by the award. The applicant organization may designate multiple individuals as program directors/principal investigators (PD/PIs) who share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project, intellectually and logistically. When multiple PD/PIs are named, each is responsible and accountable to the applicant organization, or as appropriate, to a collaborating organization for the proper conduct of the project or program including the submission of all required reports. The presence of more than one PD/PI on an application or award diminishes neither the responsibility nor the accountability of any individual PD/PI.	http://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm

A subproject may include a scientific investigation, the provision of a service or resource, or a combination of activities and receives a specific review assignment and assessment (score and/or descriptor). Most commonly, subprojects are part of the M,P,S, and U mechanisms. A consortium/subcontract is not the same as a subproject.
